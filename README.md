# About Me
Hi everyone. I am Jack Felix and I am in my second semester of my first year as a full time NCC student. I am currently enrolled in the Engineering program, but I plan to change that in my next semester to something that better suits me. Some of my interests include CrossFit, video games, and baseball. I started CrossFit around 4 years ago and fell in love with the sport. I had first started it as a means to train for baseball, but after I was unfortunately unable to make my high school team, I started to focus on CrossFit more. I started to enjoy it more and more, even to the point of competing against other athletes. While I don't play baseball anymore, I still enjoy watching it. My favortie team is the New York Yankees. In addition to sports, I am also a pretty big gamer. I have always loved to play video games, and I think this sparked my passion for computers and building them. I have actually built my own computer tower and it was the most fun thing that I have done so far. I hope that I can learn a lot in this class about coding in general, since I would like to sharpen my skills and improving my coding knowledge.
